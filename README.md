# FiveM Resource: NK_GARAGE
this project is inspired by a popular German-speaking RageMP server and aims to provide a similar garage system. Please note that the source code for this project is quite old and not up to modern standards. Some additional work and modifications may be required to ensure compatibility and optimal functionality.

The garage system was originally developed for ESX 1.2, but it should still be compatible with ESX 1.1. However, please keep in mind that some adjustments might be necessary due to the version difference.

Another important detail is that the project relies on the mysql-async library for database interactions. Please ensure that you have mysql-async properly set up and configured before using this garage system.

Feel free to modify and customize the project according to your needs. If you have any improvements or bug fixes, I'm always open to accepting pull requests. Let's collaborate and make this garage system even better!

Happy coding!
